# Praxis — BUILD STATE (canonical)

> **This file is the single source of truth for "where the work stands."**
> It replaces the two stale HTML trackers, which stored their checkbox state in
> `localStorage` (not git) and drifted ~70 cache bumps behind reality. This file
> commits its state as diff-reviewable text and is updated in the **same commit**
> that finalizes each checkpoint, so it can never go stale on the desktop again.

**Authoritative as of:** 2026-06-12
**Live:** https://praxis-reading.netlify.app
**Live CACHE_VERSION:** `praxis-v3.97`
**HEAD == origin/main:** `276d3db`
**Schema:** `state.js` static initializer `SCHEMA_VERSION: '1.9.3'` (the pinned
seed-ladder literal, never bumped); `migrate()` chain terminal step = **1.17.0**
(`state.js` ~line 1857). Runtime schema is 1.17.0; the 1.9.3 literal is expected.

**Provenance:** reconstructed and verified against `git log` (300 commits) +
`sw.js` CACHE_VERSION + `docs/checkpoints/` on 2026-06-12 (recon:
[checklist-rebuild-recon.md](../checkpoints/checklist-rebuild-recon.md)).
Refresh this stamp on every update.

**Retired artifacts (git-recoverable at these final SHAs):**
- `Praxis_Build_Checklist.html` — deleted; last content at `c0ddfe5` (2026-06-08,
  "stamp 9.6c shipped" — it predates all of Stage 10).
- `Praxis_Roadmap.html` — deleted; last content at `40de91f` (2026-06-12, the 10.5
  ship). The detailed forward-stage specs (Stage 11/12/13) live in that blob; recover
  with `git show 40de91f:"docs/Checklist and Roadmap/Praxis_Roadmap.html"`.

## Status legend (controlled vocabulary)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **SHIPPED+VERIFIED** | Commit landed + checkpoint/commit record + live confirmation with recorded evidence. |
| **SHIPPED-UNVERIFIED** | Code is in the live bundle, but a required pass-check is AWAITING or was human-handed (not contract-grade executor evidence). A residual to close. |
| **DEFERRED** | Deliberately not built; has a gate or a reason. |
| **PLANNED** | Roadmap-only; no code exists. |
| **REVERTED** | Shipped then rolled back. |

**Column conventions.** Stage 10 and the open/forward sections carry the full
per-substage schema (ID · Status · Cache@ship · Commit · Checkpoint · Live-verify ·
Residuals) — that is the live format for active work. Settled pre-protocol stages
(0–6.x) carry a leaner table (ID · Substage · Status · Commit · Notes); their
verification was **commit-based** (they predate `docs/checkpoints/`), and their cache
bumps live in `sw.js` history. Per-substage update model: a row reaches
SHIPPED+VERIFIED only when its checkpoint (or commit record) shows parse PASS +
in-band byte deltas (deviations classified, not silently widened) + matched grep
counts + a live-DOM pass-check with recorded evidence (`ss_` id / session id).

| 3 | 9.6d book-evidence layer | PLANNED | Authored, never shipped; nearest unshipped constellation sub-stage. |
| 4 | 10.5.8 = audit bug #5 writing-surface field treatment | DEFERRED | Own comp-gate; cross-linked to audit #5 (§4). |
| 5 | Visual-uplift per-surface residual backlog | OPEN | Yumi panel, settings, empty states, onboarding polish. Initiative, not a dated stage. |

## 3. Deferred & forward (PLANNED — no code)

> Detailed specs for these live in the retired `Praxis_Roadmap.html` blob (`git show 40de91f:…`).

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 11 | Yumi transparency surface | PLANNED | Required before Stage 12; absorbs field-note F3 (Yumi-in-the-writing). Partly prefigured by 6.2c "What Yumi sees". |
| Stage 12 | Public publishing (12.1–12.5) | PLANNED | publish/unpublish + Firestore mirror + pen-name ("Roland Blair") + per-publication selector. Inherits Privacy Gate A (10.4). Relocated here from 9.1. |
| Stage 13 | Social & discovery | PLANNED | Below-the-line; design after Stage 12 + 60 days live. |
| 2.7 (resequenced) | Yumi eval layer | PLANNED | The tracker's future namespace — NOT the shipped Stage 2.7b memory chain. |
| 2.6 (resequenced) | Yumi context + arc voice (`getYumiContext` dead-stub) | PLANNED | Future namespace; not the shipped Stage 2.6a/b. |
| 6.3 | Shelf search | PLANNED | |
| 5.5 / 6.4 | Ambient sound + Yumi speaking aloud (TTS) | PLANNED | |
| 6.5 | Empty & first-run states | PLANNED | Partly absorbed by 6.2b greeting. |

## 4. Open audit-bug list

Source: design chat (was **not** in the repo before this file — only item #5 was ever
transcribed, as `audit bug #5` in `10-5.md`). Ordered **strongest-first**. #1 outranks
all (broken core function, pre-launch). "A Pedagogy of Desire" content work is saved for
the very end (after this list).

- [x] **1.** Connect sub-theories no longer works · regression since 9.6c.4 · **RESOLVED** at `2e2f028` / live **v3.98**. Root cause: onboarding parked the z-9998 Yumi panel over the constellation via two paths — auto-open on `#arc/` routes + the persisted `praxis_yumi_open` flag it set and never cleared; a real click on a covered mark hit the panel, `closest('[data-st-sub-id]')` returned null, `disarm()` fired (the connect handler / `linkedSubTheories` path / panel base CSS were byte-identical to 9.6c.4 — see A-1..A-3 diagnosis). Fix: suppress the panel on `#arc/` routes (`maybeStartOnboarding` gate + `renderYumiPanel` `!isArcRoute` + `hashchange` `suppressYumiOnArc`) and make the toggle class-based (no dead first click under suppression); connect handler / constellation render / panel CSS untouched. (A first route-gate-only attempt `a0458a2` was reverted `96d7cf3` — it missed the persisted-flag path.) **PARKED (logged, do NOT fix now):** (a) pre-existing manual-open overlap — deliberately opening Yumi on an arc still covers marks; not the regression. (b) onboarding still leaves `praxis_yumi_open=true` on non-arc pages — minor UX wart. (c) Preston's personal real-account "click panes, no connection" was never confirmed to be this overlay (account onboarded, panel closed); if it recurs, the parked lead is drift-target instability on the animated marks.
- [x] **2.** Global search-result click does not navigate — ⌘K spotlight (`js/spotlight.js`) result selection does not route. — resolved: recon found no routing defect; no longer reproduces (desktop + mobile)
- [ ] **3.** Enter does not send in Yumi — Yumi input: Enter should send.
- [ ] **4.** Mobile pass, all pages — Full-app mobile sweep.
- [ ] **5.** Writing boxes feel weird / hard to engage · DEFERRED (comp-gate) — **Same tracked item as 10.5.8** (app-wide writing-surface field treatment; overrides a locked borderless spec). #5 ⟷ 10.5.8 — one item, two references, not two.
- [ ] **6.** Screen uploaded books for titles + read-status · feature — Extends the 6.1 shelf-photo scan toward read-status capture.
- [ ] **7.** User-created themes, Yumi-assisted · feature
- [ ] **8.** Developed account page · feature — Enhances the shipped 14.3.4 `#account` page.

## 5. Verification residuals to close (dedicated pass — do NOT bundle)

| Item | Why it's UNVERIFIED | Close by |
|---|---|---|
| 10.2 live pass-checks + screenshots | Logged AWAITING in `10-2.md`; only corroborated indirectly via later substages. | Run 10.2's pass-checks + capture screenshots in the test session. |
| 10.3 six eyes-on UI checks | Human-handed before the post-push contract existed; never re-run in the executor test-session pattern. Informal eyes-on ≠ contract-grade recorded evidence. | Re-run the 6 checks + rail before/after screenshots in `prestonpraxistest@gmail.com`. |

## 6. Reverts & lessons

| Event | Commits | Lesson |
|---|---|---|
| 5.6 sub-step 1 first attempt | `15ec251` reverted by `12ba756` | **Firestore merge bypasses `migrate()`** — schema migrations on remote-merged records must also touch the integrations.js merge path. 116/121 books lost tradition. |
| 5.4 Stage 2b full revert | `929d7a4`,`b220355`,`969d851` | Web-spine arc view rolled back (v3.11-c); re-scoped to the constellation. |
| Defect A (10.5) | fixed `2356479` | An `<a>` with no CSS rule falls back to the blue/underlined anchor default — add a rule mirroring the rail affordance. Same class as the 10.1-polish blue link. |
| Defect B (10.5) | fixed `2356479` | `citationPins` not backfilled on Firestore-merged records. **Standing fix:** `ensureSubTheoryFieldsAll` in the sub-theory merge backfills the full field set on every synced record — covers all future schema fields. |
| Design/privacy gates resolved | — | 10.2→Option A preview pane; 10.4 Privacy→exclude private evidence (no reader marker, owner-only rail tag — Stage 12 inherits this default); 10.5.6→Option C Write/Preview. |
| Stale-SW friction | — | A new bundle may only load after unregister-SW + clear-caches + double reload — the known manual-cache-bump cost. Every JS change after a CACHE_VERSION bump needs its own bump. |
